# Studnet-Grades

Welcome to the student grade analysis project!

In this project, I aimed to understand what factors have the most impact on student grades and to use this information to predict student grades using a decision tree model.

To begin, I collected data on various aspects of student performance, including attendance, homework completion, and test scores. I then cleaned the data to remove any missing or invalid entries.

Next, I used plots and visualizations to explore the data and identify any trends or patterns. I looked at how different factors correlated with student grades and how they changed over time.

Finally, I trained a decision tree model to predict student grades based on the collected data. The model was able to accurately predict grades for a large portion of the students, demonstrating the effectiveness of my analysis.

I hope that this analysis will be useful for educators and students looking to improve their grades and achieve academic success. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me
