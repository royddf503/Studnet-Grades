# Studnet-Grades

Welcome to the student grade analysis project!

In this project, I aimed to understand what factors have the most impact on student grades and to use this information to predict student grades using a decision tree model.

To begin, I collected data on various aspects of student performance, including attendance, homework completion, and test scores. I then cleaned the data to remove any missing or invalid entries.

Next, I used plots and visualizations to explore the data and identify any trends or patterns. I looked at how different factors correlated with student grades and how they changed over time.

Finally, I trained a decision tree model to predict student grades based on the collected data. The model was able to accurately predict grades for a large portion of the students, demonstrating the effectiveness of my analysis.
